This is the updated README.md following your specific format, incorporating the sophisticated economic logic, ethical safeguards, and the Freemium model developed through your mentor sessions.

🛡️ SmartGuard - The Autonomous Financial Guardian

🎯 Competition Track: AI & Oracles
SmartGuard is a bifurcated Fintech platform designed to transform passive budgeting into active financial discipline. Unlike traditional trackers, SmartGuard acts as an Autonomous Financial Guardian, using a "Web 2.5" approach to bridge real-world financial data with decentralized enforcement.

The platform operates on a Freemium Model:

Free Tier (Monitor): Uses Data Oracles and On-chain Hashing to provide an immutable "Financial Mirror."
Premium Tier (Guardian): Leverages Price Oracles, Advanced LLM Agents, and Smart Contract Vaults to enforce discipline through "Hard-coded Willpower."
✨ Key Features
AI-Powered Economic Logic: Uses Gemini/Genkit to calculate a Dynamic Necessity Index (DNI). It evaluates purchases based on Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) and the user’s specific Occupation Profile rather than simple "feelings."
Dual-Oracle Verification: Combines Data Oracles (fetching bank feeds) and Price Oracles (validating real-time market value) to act as a secure bridge between off-chain spending and on-chain action.
Ethical Safeguards (Soft Commitment): Implements a 2-step verification flow—AI Recommendations for cheaper alternatives followed by a 60-second Mindfulness Timer—ensuring all blockchain locks are voluntary and intentional.
Blockchain Yield Vault: Automatically locks "impulse overages" into a DeFi-integrated Smart Contract. Funds generate passive income through decentralized lending protocols (e.g., Aave) during the lock period.
Immutable Financial Passport: Hashes and anchors transaction data to the Polygon network, creating a tamper-proof "Audit Trail" of financial discipline that preserves user privacy while proving creditworthiness.
🏗️ Architecture
Frontend: Next.js 15 (React 19) + Tailwind CSS
Web3 Integration: Simulated via Thirdweb SDK for MVP
Blockchain: Polygon Amoy Testnet (Simulated transaction logging)
AI: Purchase categorization and Economic modeling using Genkit & Gemini.

📜 Legal Compliance
SmartGuard MVP - Competition Prototype

Informed Consent: Every blockchain lock is preceded by a "Discipline Agreement" signed and hashed on-chain during onboarding.
Non-Custodial: This is a decentralized tool. Users maintain full custody of their funds via their own private wallets and self-executing smart contracts.
Educational Purpose: This is not a licensed financial service. All "locks" and "yields" are performed on the Polygon Testnet using non-value test tokens for demonstration.
Accountability: The 2-step verification process provides a transparent "Intent Attestation," protecting the platform and user from accidental or forced fund locking.
